Introduction:
In the last part, weâ€™ll use the Returns table to see if some products have abnormal rates of being returned to the store.

Objectives:
1. Which products have the highest return rate?
2. Which customers have the highest return rate?
3. Present a visual argument why the superstore should do away with or keep doing business on the basis of this dimension.

Finding & Recommendations:
1. There are 8 products with 100% return rate. Consider discontinuing those products. All other products listed have return rates of more than 7% and should be considered for discontinuation as well.
2. Roland Murray and Hilary Holden bothe at return rates of 100%. Consider customer incentives to promote product/brand satisfaction.
3. Oregon, Tennessee, Colorado, Arizona, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Texas all have average profits below $0. Oregon, Tennessee, Colorado, Arizona, and Ohio have high return rates and should be considered to stop doing business.
